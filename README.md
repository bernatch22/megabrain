Point megabrain at a repo and ask **"how does auth work"** in plain English. It finds
*all* the related code — in ~200 ms, using **no LLM**, just math on embeddings — and an
LLM narrates a walkthrough with the **real code spliced in from disk**. Nothing is
invented: every line shown is copied verbatim.

Use it from the terminal, as an **MCP server inside Claude Code**, or as a Python library.

## Quickstart — the easy path, no API keys

Everything runs on your machine: `ask` narrates on your **Claude Code** subscription,
embeddings run locally on **Ollama**. No cloud keys.

```bash
pip install 'megabrain[claude]'                      # engine + Claude Code narration

ollama pull nomic-embed-text                          # local embeddings, one time
export MEGABRAIN_EMBED_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
export MEGABRAIN_EMBED_MODEL=nomic-embed-text

megabrain index ~/your/repo                           # once — incremental after
megabrain ask   ~/your/repo "how does auth work end to end"
```

`ask` uses your logged-in `claude` CLI (free on your plan); embeddings never leave your
machine. No OpenRouter, no Anthropic key.

**Which model?** On Claude Code, `ask` narrates with **Haiku** by default (fast + cheap
on your plan). Bump it with a Claude alias — `export MEGABRAIN_ASK_MODEL=sonnet` (or
`opus`). ⚠️ On the `claude` provider this must be a **Claude** model (`haiku`/`sonnet`/
`opus`/a `claude-*` id), not an OpenRouter slug like `google/…`.

## Inside Claude Code

Register it as an MCP server and research any indexed repo without leaving Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add megabrain -- python3 -m megabrain.mcp_server
```

Then use `megabrain_ask` / `megabrain_query` instead of grep + Read chains — one call
replaces minutes of file-crawling. Tools: **`megabrain_ask`** (narrated walkthrough),
**`megabrain_query`** (raw code map, no LLM — pass `prune_noise: true` for just the
signal chunks worth reading, ranked flat), `megabrain_get`, `megabrain_chunks`,
`megabrain_index`.

## Commands

```bash
megabrain index  ~/repo                          # build / update the index
megabrain ask    ~/repo "how does X work"        # narrated walkthrough + real code
megabrain query  ~/repo "retry logic"            # raw code map, no LLM (~200 ms)
megabrain query  ~/repo "retry logic" --prune    # flat signal-only chunks, no LLM (drops the noise)
megabrain get    ~/repo src/x.py --symbol Foo    # one file or symbol
megabrain forge  ~/repo                          # teach it your repo's file types (below)
megabrain serve-api ~/repo                       # long-running HTTP API (warm state)
```

Scope to a sub-folder (`~/repo/src/auth`), search several repos at once
(`~/a,~/b`), and the index auto-refreshes when files change on disk.

## Rather use the cloud?

No Claude Code or Ollama? One key runs **everything** through OpenRouter — embeddings
and narration — with sensible defaults:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
megabrain ask ~/repo "how does X work"
```

megabrain auto-picks the narrator: **Claude** when its SDK is installed, otherwise
OpenRouter. Embeddings always go through OpenRouter or a local endpoint (Anthropic has no
embeddings API).

Pin the provider and models with env vars (any OpenRouter slug):

```bash
export MEGABRAIN_CHAT_PROVIDER=openrouter                          # pin openrouter (skip claude auto-pick)
export MEGABRAIN_ASK_MODEL=google/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview    # the `ask` narration model
export MEGABRAIN_EMBED_MODEL=perplexity/pplx-embed-v1-0.6b         # the embedding model
```

The full provider matrix — native APIs, hybrid, fully-local GPU, per-provider defaults —
is in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 100% open-source stack (measured, no closed-weight anything)

Every default above uses a proprietary model somewhere (pplx embeddings, Gemini/Claude
narration). If you want zero closed weights — private code, an air-gapped box, or just
principle — this combo is **measured, not a guess**, and holds up:

```bash
# 1. embeddings — Apache 2.0, code-tuned, runs on your machine, $0
ollama serve
ollama pull unclemusclez/jina-embeddings-v2-base-code    # 322 MB, one time
export MEGABRAIN_EMBED_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
export MEGABRAIN_EMBED_MODEL=unclemusclez/jina-embeddings-v2-base-code

# 2. narration — Apache 2.0 (Qwen), via OpenRouter (or self-host on the same Ollama)
export MEGABRAIN_CHAT_PROVIDER=openrouter
export MEGABRAIN_ASK_MODEL=qwen/qwen3-coder

megabrain index ~/your/repo --force
megabrain ask   ~/your/repo "how does X work"
```

**Retrieval recall** (R@1 on a 22-question golden set, sdk-server — does the right
file land #1):

| stack | R@1 | weights | cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| pplx + closed narrator *(the cloud default above)* | 0.591 | closed | ~$0.01/ask |
| **jina-code (local) + qwen3-coder** *(this section)* | 0.455 | **all open** | **$0 embed** + ~$0.01/ask on OpenRouter, or $0 fully self-hosted |

**Does `ask` actually still work?** Ran the same two real questions against
sdk-server with this exact stack:

- *"where is barge-in handled when the user interrupts mid-speech"* → correctly
  narrated from `turn_controller.py`, citing 4 files total (`event_bus.py`,
  `bot_handler.py`, `webhooks.py` too) — broader than the closed-default run.
- *"how does an inbound websocket client get authenticated"* → correctly
  narrated from `transports/client/handler.py`, the same file the closed stack found.

Both answers were grounded (every code block spliced verbatim, nothing invented) and
landed on the right file — the open stack is a **real, usable** alternative, not a
token gesture. The one real cost: `qwen/qwen3-coder` narrates in **~20-25 s** per ask
vs ~6 s for Gemini Flash — output-bound, not retrieval-bound, so it's the same
trade-off as the cloud cheap-vs-fast pick. `qwen3-coder` also runs on the *same*
local Ollama for a fully air-gapped setup (no OpenRouter call at all) — just slower
without a GPU. Full comparison + a weaker general-purpose local embedder (e5-large,
0.364 R@1) in [docs/GUIDE.md §2b](docs/GUIDE.md#2b-local-embeddings-ollama-0-code-never-leaves-your-machine).

## How it works

| stage | what happens |
|---|---|
| **index** | code is split over its syntax tree (whole functions / classes, never arbitrary line windows), embedded once, stored in SQLite. Incremental by hash. |
| **query** | **no LLM** — your question is embedded and matched by vector similarity. Returns every related file in ~200 ms; nothing is dropped. |
| **ask** | one LLM call narrates the answer and cites code as `[[k]]`; the engine replaces each citation with the verbatim block from disk. The model can only *point* at code, never rewrite it — so nothing is hallucinated. Broad questions fan out into parallel sub-agents, then a parent synthesizes. |
| **forge** | for a file type the engine doesn't index yet (`.toml`, `.astro`, a private DSL), an LLM writes a chunking strategy — accepted only after it partitions *every* matching file exactly. One-time, at your command, off the query path. |
| **flows** *(opt-in)* | turn it on and every `ask` caches its cross-file walkthrough; the next related question retrieves the whole workflow at once. Off by default — plain query/ask are unchanged. |

Languages: **Python · JS/TS · Markdown** built in; **Ruby · Go · Rust · PHP** with
`pip install 'megabrain[languages]'`; **anything else** via `megabrain forge` (below).

## forge — megabrain writes its own chunkers

Repos carry more than code: `.toml`, `.yaml`, `.astro`, `.proto`, private DSLs…
Anything outside the registry is invisible to retrieval. `megabrain forge` fixes
that per repo:

```bash
megabrain forge ~/repo --list        # census: which text file types aren't indexed (free)
megabrain forge ~/repo               # LLM-write a chunking strategy per type, validate, install
megabrain forge ~/repo --dry-run     # show the generated code without installing
```

For each uncovered extension, an LLM (same provider stack as `ask`) writes a
`ChunkStrategy` from the contract source + real sample files, and it is only
accepted after chunking **every** matching file in the repo with a clean
exact-line partition (`validate_partition` — failures feed a repair loop, and
nothing unvetted ever installs). The vetted module lands in
`.megabrain/strategies/<ext>.py`, sha-recorded in a user-level trust store
(`~/.megabrain/trust.json`), and from then on every index — including the 60 s
auto-refresh — loads it automatically. Hand-written strategies work the same
way: drop the file in `.megabrain/strategies/` and approve it with
`megabrain trust ~/repo`.

Real run on [pallets/click](https://github.com/pallets/click): forge detected
`.toml` (11 files) and `.yaml` (8 workflows), generated both strategies on the
first attempt (~28 s total), and *"which workflow runs the test suite?"* went
from missing entirely to ranking `.github/workflows/tests.yaml` #1.

### `--specialize` — measure a hand-written chunker (no LLM)

For a file type the engine ALREADY reads but chunks poorly (a giant lookup
table blobs; a class of many tiny methods merges), you can hand-write a better
strategy and have the engine *measure* it before it installs:

```bash
megabrain forge ~/repo --specialize          # census: covered files the built-in chunks poorly
# write a ChunkStrategy into .megabrain/strategies/<ext>.py, then gate it:
python -c "from megabrain.forge.specialize import gate_strategy; \
           print(gate_strategy('~/repo', open('strat.py').read(), '.py'))"
```

`gate_strategy` indexes the built-in vs your candidate for real, scores span-IoU
+ hit@1 on neutral probes over every file the candidate changes, and installs
(trust-gated) **only if it beats a literature-tuned baseline** — never on a
whisper of improvement.

> **We tried letting an LLM write these and removed it.** Across four repos the
> generated chunkers lost to a five-line deterministic recipe. And the deeper,
> measured finding: on a *real* query set (the sdk-server golden) **tighter
> chunks LOWER retrieval ranking** — the 4000-char merge concentrates a file's
> evidence and that is what wins R@1 (4000 → 0.86, 2000 → 0.82, blob-split →
> 0.77). Tighter chunks help *navigation* (fewer lines to read) but not
> retrieval. **The built-in default is a genuine optimum; leave it alone unless
> you measure a win.** Specialization is for the rare pathological file, gated
> hard.

## flows — self-caching workflow retrieval (opt-in, off by default)

Every `ask` synthesizes a cross-file **workflow** ("VAD detects speech →
`TurnController.on_vad_start` → cancel TTS") that the engine used to discard.
Turn the flow cache on and it keeps them: the next related question — even
worded completely differently — retrieves the whole workflow at once.

```bash
megabrain ask ~/repo "how does X work"       # unchanged: flows are OFF by default
megabrain flows ~/repo --enable              # opt in for this repo; asks now cache their flows
megabrain index ~/repo --warm-flows 12       # or pre-fill: discover the repo's 12 top workflows now
megabrain flows ~/repo                        # list what's cached · --clear to reset
```

- **Off by default** — plain `query`/`ask` behave byte-for-byte as before, at
  zero cost. It's a mode a team turns on so its megabrain accumulates the repo's
  workflows from use (great for onboarding).
- **Rules intact:** the LLM + the one embed happen at *ask* time (write path);
  the read path is pure cosine. Flows only *add* their source files to the
  bundle when missing (never displace real files → completeness only rises), and
  the narrator gets the cached flow as non-citable context. Any flow whose cited
  files change sha is pruned on the next index — a stale walkthrough can't
  outlive its code, and `ask` splices real code regardless.

Validated on sdk-server: `--warm-flows 5` discovered and cached the system's
main workflows; a paraphrase ("how does the bot stop talking when the user cuts
in") retrieved the barge-in flow cached from a differently-worded question.
